/*
    Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing system, while powerful, can sometimes make it
    challenging to share data across different parts of your code. A common solution
    to this challenge is using Reference Counting.

    Reference Counting (using Rc in Rust) allows multiple parts of a program to hold
    a shared reference to the same data. Once the last reference is dropped, the data
    is automatically deallocated.

/// The Person struct demonstrates how to store a shared, reference counted value.
/// By wrapping the name in an Rc<String>, multiple owners can safely share and manage
/// the same data without violating Rust's ownership rules. The underlying string
/// is deallocated when the last reference is dropped.
struct Person {
    // The name field is wrapped in an Rc to enable shared ownership.

    /// Creates a new Person instance with a reference counted name.
